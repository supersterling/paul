# optimizePackageImports
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-01-23



> This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it is not recommended for production.

Some packages can export hundreds or thousands of modules, which can cause performance issues in development and production.

Adding a package to `experimental.optimizePackageImports` will only load the modules you are actually using, while still giving you the convenience of writing import statements with many named exports.

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: ['package-name'],
  },
}
```

The following libraries are optimized by default:

* `lucide-react`
* `date-fns`
* `lodash-es`
* `ramda`
* `antd`
* `react-bootstrap`
* `ahooks`
* `@ant-design/icons`
* `@headlessui/react`
* `@headlessui-float/react`
* `@heroicons/react/20/solid`
* `@heroicons/react/24/solid`
* `@heroicons/react/24/outline`
* `@visx/visx`
* `@tremor/react`
* `rxjs`
* `@mui/material`
* `@mui/icons-material`
* `recharts`
* `react-use`
* `@material-ui/core`
* `@material-ui/icons`
* `@tabler/icons-react`
* `mui-core`
* `react-icons/*`
* `effect`
