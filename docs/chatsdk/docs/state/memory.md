# Memory



An in-memory state adapter for development and testing. Zero configuration required.

<Callout type="warn">
  Only use the memory adapter for local development and testing. State is lost on restart and locks don't work across multiple instances. For production, use [Redis](/docs/state/redis) or [ioredis](/docs/state/ioredis).
</Callout>

## Installation

```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm add @chat-adapter/state-memory
```

## Usage

```typescript title="lib/bot.ts" lineNumbers
import { Chat } from "chat";
import { createMemoryState } from "@chat-adapter/state-memory";

const bot = new Chat({
  userName: "mybot",
  adapters: { /* ... */ },
  state: createMemoryState(),
});
```

No configuration options are needed.

## Features

* Thread subscriptions (in-memory)
* Locking (single-process only)
* Zero configuration

## Limitations

* **Not suitable for production** — state is lost on restart
* **Single process only** — locks don't work across multiple instances
* **No persistence** — subscriptions reset when the process restarts

## When to use

* Local development
* Unit testing
* Quick prototyping
